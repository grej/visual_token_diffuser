the cat sits on the mat
the dog runs in the park
birds fly in the sky
fish swim in the water
the sun shines bright today
rain falls from dark clouds
trees grow tall and strong
flowers bloom in the spring
cats and dogs are pets
birds sing in the morning
water flows in the river
sun gives us light
rain helps plants grow
trees provide fresh air
